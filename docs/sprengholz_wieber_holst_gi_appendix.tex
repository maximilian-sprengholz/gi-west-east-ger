	% De-Rounding
	\section{De-Rounding}\label{derounding}
	\setcounter{table}{0}
	\setcounter{figure}{0}

	In the SOEP data used here, there is a substantial fraction of couples with exactly the same income. By implication of the McCrary discontinuity test with the cut-off set at the point of equal earnings, any heaping in the data at a relative income of exactly 0.5 would result in an overestimated discontinuity. Additionally, the dummy $wifeEarnsMore$ used as main explanatory variable in the fixed effects regressions would also be affected by such heaping, as we cannot identify which spouse actually earns more, given that some of the calculated income shares do not resemble the true values.

	After accounting for possible heaping effects by imputed or top-coded values, co-working or self employment of spouses, we presume the remaining spike of 0.6\% to be a result of rounding behavior by survey respondents. In the SOEP, each respondent is surveyed individually, therefore the spike cannot originate in rounding or misreporting by the head of the household answering for other household members. Even so, most individually reported income data is expected to be rounded to some extent \citep{drechsler2015beat, zinn2016statistical}. Thus, we adjust the income share distribution according to rounding probabilities in administrative income tax data (FAST 2010, doi: 10.21242/73111.2010.00.00.3.1.0). That is, we de-round rounded income values for the fraction of couples in the SOEP exceeding the respective fraction in the income tax data.

	If the couple is selected for de-rounding, a random draw from a normal distribution $N (0; R_k /3)$ is added to the individual income values, where $R_k$  determines half the range of the rounding interval $R = k/2$ of integer multiples of $k = [50; 100; 500; 1000; 5000; 10000]$. To ensure that 99 percent of the de-rounded income values $I_1$ lie within $[I_0 - R_k ; I_0 + R_k ]$, where $I_0$ is the observed income and $k$ the maximum possible $k$ that $I_0$ is divisible by, the standard deviation is set to $\sigma = R_k /3$. One percent of drawn values are allowed to randomly exceed the interval. For example, an income value of 25,000 would be de-rounded by adding a random draw from $N(0; 2500/3)$. Since heaping probabilities are unknown with regard to income (Drechsler and Kiesl, 2015), this approach is an approximation based on the assumptions that (1) respondent's propensity to round is likely to increase with proximity to a heaping point \citep{zinn2016statistical} and (2) the actual incidence of rounded income values in the tax data is genuine. Relative frequencies are calculated based on annual income from dependent employment reported in the official tax data for employees by income brackets $[1; 10,000],$ $(10,000; 20,000],$ $(20,000; 35,000],$ $(35,000; 60,000],$ $(60,000; 999,999]$, sample region (East/West) and sex to additionally account for differences in rounding behavior depending on the place of residence, sex and the absolute amount of income. However, the estimation may be biased due to differences in rounding behavior over time (tax data is used from 2010 only).

	By de-rounding, the share of equal earning partners in the sample is substantially reduced from 0.6 percent to 0.2 percent.

However, we do not find it very sensible to include the logarithm of the sum of the husband's and wife's annual labor income because this term would be perfectly collinear with both constituents without the log transformation. It would be hard to say where the remaining variation for the modeled relationship comes from.

		In earlier versions of this paper, we estimated the specification
		$$
		\begin{aligned}
		wifeEarnsMore_{it} &= \alpha_i + \beta_1 wifeEarnsMore_{i,t-1} + \beta_2 L_{i,t-1} + \beta_3 X_{it} + \epsilon_{it} \quad.
		\end{aligned}
		$$
		However, our results turned out to be very instable and sensitive to analysis period adjustments, suggesting dynamic panel bias \cite[see][for a detailed account]{roodman2009how}. Here we test different models to investigate this possible issue. We implement the Arellano-Bond estimator (difference GMM), the Blundell-Bond estimator (system GMM) and a Least Squares Dummy Variable estimator with bias correction (LSDVC) as proposed by \cite{bruno2005estimation}.

		Dynamic panel bias arises in autoregressive fixed effects models of the form $y_{it} = \rho y_{i,t-1} + \alpha_i + \epsilon_{it}$ because $y_{i,t-1}$ is correlated with the fixed effect $\alpha_i$, making the FE estimator inconsistent. Variation in $y_{it}$ due to the fixed effect might then be incorrenctly attributed as explanatory power to $y_{i,t-1}$, inflating $\rho$.

		We test the stability of coefficient estimates for $wifeEarnsMore_{i,t-1}$ using a set of theoretically appropriate models. In practice, however, both GMM models are prone to misspecification and it is hard to say whether specific covariates are, for example, strictly exogenous or not regarding the error term. We therefore also present the estimates of a different approach (LSDVC), where the standard within-transformed regression estimates are bias corrected un to $O(1/T)$. Tables D.25 and D.26 provide the respective results.

		Apparently, our FE estimates do suffer from dynamic panel bias as they are, for the most part, substantially different from the AB, BB, and LSDVC estimates. However, the dynamic panel model results are also very heterogenous across estimators. Although AB, BB, and LSDVC coefficients lie within the bounds of OLS and FE estimates, there is no clear pattern either in coefficient size nor significance that would allow any substantive interpretation. The LSDVC estimates seem interesting, as they more generally reflect what we also directly observe in the data: For a wife who out-earns her husbands in t$-1$, this out-earning is associated with an increase in her probability to do so in $t$. While this general positive association is not surprising, the respective probability increase differs between West and East Germany and analysis periods, showing a similar trend as the rest of our estimates.

		Nonetheless, the instability of estimates leaves us no other choice than to exclude this regression result. A thorough methodological investigation would make for another paper. Consequently, we can no longer estimate a `gross effect' of a wife's out-earning of her husband on her out-earning probability in the subsequent year. However, looking at the effects on specific outcomes like the wife's labor force participation or working hours arrangements is still possible as these panel models are not dynamic ($wifeEarnsMore$ is only used as independent variable).
